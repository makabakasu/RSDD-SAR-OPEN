# RSDD-SAR: Rotated Ship Detection Dataset in SAR Images
This is a rotated SAR ship detection dataset, named Rotated Ship Detection Dataset in SAR Images(RSDD-SAR). RSDD-SAR consists of 84 scenes GF-3 data slices, 41 scenes TerraSAR-X data slices, and 2 scenes uncropped large images, including 7,000 slices and 10,263 ship instances of multi-source, multi-observing modes, multi-polarization modes and multi-resolution.
